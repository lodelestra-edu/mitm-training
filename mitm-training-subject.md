##A/ Setup the lab
The first part of this training is to setup your lab.   

@. Virtualbox.   
For your practical work Virtualbox is already installed.

Computers in A214 have /VM/ folder shared by every system in that machine. Before adding the first VM you need to change the default image directory for /VM.

@. Installing Kali Linux
Offensive Security (the company behind Kali) provide a pre-installed VM of Kali.   
The pre-installed VM is already downloaded on your computer in the /VM/ directory.   
Start Virtualbox and click 'file/import Appliance' and import the Kali-Linux-2.0.0-vbox-i686.ova file.   
**if you cant found the .ova file in /VM/**, it can be download.   
Download url:   
Kali Linux for VMware and VirtualBox   
https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/   
Be sure to download the VirtualBox one (by default it display the VMware) 64bit with PAE.   

@. Installing Metaspoitable   
Metasploitable is a vulnerable distribution provided by rapid7 the company behind the Metasploit framework.   
It's also already downloaded on your computer in /VM/ directory'.   
Unzip it into /VM/ and add this existing VM into VirtualBox.   
Start Virtualbox, click 'New' and select 'use an existing virtual hard disk file', point to '/VM/metasploitable--/--.vmdk', and create.   
Run it. Use login:msfadmin password:msfadmin   
Check the network interface.   
**if you cant found the metasploitable archive in /VM/**, it can be download.   
Download link:   
http://downloads.metasploit.com/data/metasploitable/metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip   

@. Installing Lubuntu   
Lubuntu is the client machine (here the victim).   
Do the same as previously with Metasploitable. The existing VDI file must be in /VM/lubuntu/   
Start Virtualbox, click 'New' and select 'use an existing virtual hard disk file'. Use /VM/lubuntu/lubuntu.vdi   
user: osboxes | password:osboxes.org   
**if you cant find the vdi file in /VM/**, you can download it here:   
http://www.osboxes.org/lubuntu/   

@. Create an internal network   
Change every existing interface to use the same internal network named 'lab'.   
Login to every VM to set the IP address.   
Lubuntu: 192.168.0.10 | Metasploitable: 192.168.0.11 | Kali: 192.168.0.20   
**Check all the VMs can ping each other. From every VM. Yes realy, do that, it's important!**   





##B/Start the attack

@. In the lubuntu box
- open the browser and look a http://192.168.0.11
- go to the phpmyadmin page. Everything should be normal
- open a terminal and look at your arp table with `arp -n`

@. In the kali box   

- You must allow the packets to be forwarded between the server and the client. `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` 
- Open a new terminal. You need to spoof the mac adress of the server (metasploitable) with your own in the client box(lubuntu) `arpspoof -t 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.11`
- Open a new terminal. You need to spoof the mac adress of the client (lubuntu) with your own in the server box(metasploitable) `arpspoof -t 192.168.0.11 192.168.0.10`
- Open Wireshark software and look at your eth0 interface.

@. In the lubuntu box

- go back to your browser and refresh the phpmyadmin page (use ctrl+f5).

@. In the kali box
- In your wireshark... this is where the magic happens! You must see the http request and reply.

@. With your kali and lubuntu.

- Try to login the phpmyadmin page. Find the user and password in your wireshark.
- Try the drifnet tool in your kali `drifnet -i eth0`. In your lubuntu go to the dvwa/login.php page (refresh with ctrl+f5 if needed).
